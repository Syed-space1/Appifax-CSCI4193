## Purpose

We have developed Appifax to better support local businesses that are struggling during the COVID-19 crisis, and help them  emerge and thrive in and beyond the post pandemic world by providing them the platform.

## Description of the Platform

We are developing Appifax, a Halifax point-based membership webapp that can be used for local businesses who require support and partner with our services. There would be members-only offers/prices for certain items at our partner locations, and the user collects points for each order which could then be redeemed at any of our partner locations. Users can start using the app for free. However, there will be premium subscriptions available to them that provide better value. Once tested in Halifax, we can scale it to other cities.
